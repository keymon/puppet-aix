Puppet AIX Extensions
=====================

:Author: Hector Rivas Gandara <keymon@gmail.com>

Description
-----------

These were some extensions to use puppet with AIX hosts. Now this module is obsolete.

I deprecated this code and I added as tickets in puppet source:

 - Users and groups http://projects.puppetlabs.com/issues/5432 and https://github.com/keymon/puppet/tree/feature/master/5432
 - Mount: http://projects.puppetlabs.com/issues/5682 and https://github.com/keymon/puppet/tree/feature/master/5682
